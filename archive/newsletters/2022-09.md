# GoToSocial Newsletter - September 2022

Hello humans, non-human entities, and others!

Welcome to the inaugural GoToSocial newsletter! We're gonna try writing these once a month to keep people up to date on what's been going on at the SuperSeriousBusiness **volcano headquarters**. Maybe we'll even write them on time, wouldn't that be something!

## v0.5.0 Sonorous Sloth progress

This month we've been working our butts off on **v0.5.0 Sonorous Sloth**, which is the next Alpha release of GoToSocial in the pipeline. We've already got a first release candidate out for this version, so fingers crossed the final release might already be out by the time you read this!

### Custom Emojis

The next release has a bunch of oft-requested features in it. More specifically: support for federating custom emojis.

Thanks to our extremely delicate scientific research in the **emoji lab**, in which we subject emojii to **exciting experiments**, we managed to get custom emojo federating in and out, and displaying properly in status web views.

Here's some interesting factoids about GoToSocial emoji support:

- By default we kept the Mastodon emoji size limit of 50kb when uploading emojons, but this can easily be changed in your instance configuration.
- For remote emojoo, which your instance downloads from other instances, the default size limit is 100kb, to ease federation with instances with higher limits.
- No emojis were harmed in the making of this feature.
